This directory includes the code I used to run experiments for the competition.  Despite starting only a few weeks before the deadline and having very limited time to invest, I managed to place in the top 25%.<br/>

I used the Anaconda distribution of Python with the IPython kernel and PyCharm IDE to run experiments.  I also installed and configured several additional dependencies (xgboost and pylearn 2).  There are three scripts of interest:<br/>

higgs.py - Primarily based on scikit-learn solutions<br/>
higgs-adv.py - Switched to a Linux VM and incorporated the xgboost library<br/>
higgs-nn.py - Set up pylearn 2 and started experimenting with deep learning neural nets (unfortunately I ran out of time before making any significant progress here)<br/>

The scripts are fairly basic due to time constraints but well-modularized and easy to follow.  Enjoy!
